          <p>
            Welcome to our kidney donation platform! We aim to connect individuals in need of a kidney transplant with
            willing donors, even if their own family members are not suitable donors. Our unique approach, inspired by
            the concept of a life cycle, ensures that everyone has an opportunity to give and receive the gift of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our website allows individuals to enter their medical data and the details of their family members who wish to
            donate a kidney. By collecting and storing this information, we facilitate the matching process between donors
            and recipients. Through a carefully designed system, we ensure that the circle of giving and receiving is
            completed, creating a positive impact on the lives of those involved.

          <h2>Data Entry and Matching</h2>
          <div class="divider mb-3 title" style={{marginRight: "auto!importent",marginLeft:"0em"}}></div>

          <p>
            Our website provides easy-to-use forms for both donors and individuals in need of a kidney transplant. Donors
            can enter their medical data and indicate their willingness to donate. Similarly, those in need of a kidney
            can provide their medical information and details of their family members who wish to donate on their behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the data is entered, our system performs a sophisticated matching process to identify potential matches
            between donors and recipients. Through advanced algorithms, we ensure compatibility and maximize the chances
            of successful kidney transplantation.

//       <h1>Cross-Over Kidney Donation</h1>
//       <p>
//         Cross-over kidney donation, also known as paired kidney exchange or kidney swap, is a transplant option for
//         individuals who have a willing but incompatible living donor. In this program, two or more donor-recipient pairs
//         who are incompatible with their respective donors are matched with other pairs to facilitate kidney
//         transplantation.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         The process involves finding a compatible match between the incompatible pairs, where each donor gives a kidney
//         to the recipient in another pair. This allows the recipients to receive a compatible kidney from a willing
//         donor, even if it is not their own family member or loved one.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Cross-over kidney donation programs have significantly expanded the pool of potential kidney donors and improved
//         the chances of finding compatible matches for patients in need of a transplant. It offers hope and increased
//         opportunities for those who may not have had a suitable living donor within their own family.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If you or a loved one is in need of a kidney transplant and have a willing but incompatible donor, cross-over
//         kidney donation may be a viable option to explore. Consult with your healthcare team or transplant center to
//         learn more about the eligibility criteria and process for participating in a cross-over kidney donation program.
