          <h2>Medical Information for Donors</h2>
          <p>
            As a potential kidney donor, it's important to understand the medical aspects involved in the donation
            process. Here, we provide you with essential information to help you make an informed decision and ensure
            your well-being throughout the journey.
          </p>
          <h3>Eligibility and Screening</h3>
          <p>
            Not everyone is eligible to be a kidney donor. The screening process is designed to assess your overall health
            and compatibility with the recipient. Factors such as blood type, tissue match, and general health conditions
            are taken into consideration. It's crucial to undergo comprehensive medical evaluations and consultations with
            healthcare professionals to determine your suitability.
          </p>
          <h3>Surgical Procedure</h3>
          <p>
            Kidney donation involves a surgical procedure known as nephrectomy, where one of your kidneys is removed. It's
            typically performed laparoscopically, which minimizes scarring and promotes faster recovery. The procedure
            is performed under general anesthesia by skilled surgeons specializing in organ transplantation.
          </p>
          <h3>Recovery and Aftercare</h3>
          <p>
            After the surgery, you'll need to take time to recover and allow your body to heal. The medical team will
            closely monitor your progress and provide guidance on post-operative care. It's important to follow their
            instructions, take prescribed medications, and attend follow-up appointments to ensure a smooth recovery.
          </p>
          <h3>Long-Term Health Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Donating a kidney does not typically have significant long-term health implications for most donors. However,
            it's essential to be aware of potential risks and monitor your health regularly. The medical team will provide
            guidance on lifestyle adjustments, such as maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, and
            managing any potential health conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, the decision to become a kidney donor is a personal one. It's crucial to have open discussions with
            your healthcare provider, ask questions, and fully understand the medical implications before proceeding with
            the donation process.
